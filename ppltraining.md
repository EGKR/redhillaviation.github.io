It is a mistake to think you need a lot of qualifications or skills to get a PPL / LAPL. More important is determination to achieve.

The PPL is the most popular licence as it allows a range of recreational flights in a greater variety of aircraft and lets you gain additional ratings. It is also the first step on the way to a commercial licence if progressing via the modular route.

We offer a choice of the Cessna 152 and Piper Archer aircraft for training, some people like to try a lesson on each to see which suits them best. Instruction is on a one to one basis and we try to keep you with the same instructor as far as possible.

The 45 hour [mandatory minimum] course is arranged to ensure you have all the skills needed. You will be briefed before and after each lesson, do not be afraid to ask if you do not understand.

<h4>Dual Instruction</h4>
The course requires at least 25 hours of dual instruction. This will include all the exercises needed to progress to First Solo, often achieved between 12 and 18 hours. Then itâ€™s on to more advanced flying such as emergency landings, navigation and landing away from Redhill.

<h4>Solo Flying</h4>
Once you can take off and land safely, you will perform your first solo, always a landmark step on the way. By then you will have passed the Aviation Law, Operational Procedures and Human Performance and Limitations exams and have a medical certificate from a CAA approved medical examiner.

After passing the Navigation and Meteorology exams, you will do your first solo flight into the local area. Eventually you will have done over 10 hours solo flying, including a qualifying cross-country flight of at least 150 nautical miles, landing at two other airfields before coming back to Redhill.


<h4>Ground Examinations</h4>

There are 9 written multiple choice ground examinations to be passed, and an oral Communications Practical test.

Examinations are conducted here when the student feels ready, results are soon available. The EASA syllabus requires 4 hours ground school and 7 or 8 hours self-study on each subject.
Study books and practice questions are available to purchase for all examination subjects. Your Instructor will always answer any questions you may have on a particular subject

The exams are:
(a & b) Air Law and Operational Procedures: covering the rules and regulations of aviation
(c) Human Performance and Limitations: the effects of flight on the physiology of the body and explores psychological effects too
(d) Navigation and Radio Aids: this exam covers the theory involved in safe navigation
(e) Meteorology: helps you to gain a greater appreciation and understanding of the effects of weather on flights.
(f & g) Aircraft General and Principles of Flight: these exams test your knowledge of how an aeroplane flies, what makes it work and the technical names of some of the parts.
(h) Flight Performance and Planning: an aeroplane has to be loaded and balanced correctly if it is to fly safely! This exam involves planning a cross-country navigation flight using your knowledge of both navigation and aircraft performance.
(i) Communications (written): you will learn how to use the radio. The exam tests your knowledge of the correct radio calls and procedures.
(j) Communications Practical (Oral): this must be done after the written Communications exam. It consists of a simulated flight in which you act as pilot on a cross-country flight and the examiner acts as the various controllers you encounter.

Skill Test

After you have completed all the flying training and ground exams, it will be time for your skill test with an in-house examiner. This usually takes around 2 hours and is designed to show that you can fly the aircraft safely and follow a route and do a diversion.
