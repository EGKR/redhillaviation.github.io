<div id="experience">
    <div class="experience-title">30 or 60 minute air experience flight</div>
The air experience package consists of a short pre-flight briefing conducted in the classroom, or the aircraft, followed by a 30 or 60 minute introductory flying session with one of our qualified flight instructors. In either case you will get a chance both to fly the aircraft and to enjoy the view.

    <div class="experience-title">Aerobatics Experience</div>
    The aerobatics experiences are the ultimate thrill for those with a sense of adventure, or friends and family with a mean streak.
    The 30 minute aerobatics experience is flown with a qualified aerobatics instructor in our Cessna 152 Aerobat. Enjoy the exhilaration of looping the loop, a barrel roll, a stall turn and a spin then back to boast about it to friends and family.
    The 60 minute aerobatic special is a combination of the introductory flying lesson with the thrill of the aerobatic experience.
